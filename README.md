# SNAKE_GAME

Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has been popular since its introduction in the late 1970s. The objective of the game is to navigate a snake around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. Implementing the Snake Game in Java is a great way to practice and enhance your skills in game development and Java programming.

Features
Game Board: A grid where the snake moves and food appears.
Snake Movement: Controlled using arrow keys (or WASD keys) to change direction.
Food Generation: Randomly placed food that the snake eats to grow longer.
Collision Detection: Game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.
Difficulty Levels: Option to adjust the speed of the snake, making the game more challenging.
Sound Effects: Optional sound effects for movements and collisions to enhance the gaming experience.
Implementation Details
The Snake Game in Java typically involves the following components:

GamePanel: A class that extends JPanel and implements ActionListener and KeyListener for handling game updates and user inputs.
Snake: A list of coordinates representing the segments of the snake. The snake grows by adding segments when it eats food.
Food: A single coordinate on the game board where the food is placed. It is randomly generated within the bounds of the game board.
Game Loop: A timer that triggers game updates at regular intervals, controlling the movement of the snake and checking for collisions.
Collision Handling: Methods to check if the snake has collided with the walls or itself, ending the game if a collision is detected.
Score Display: A method to display the current score and a game over message when the game ends.
Key Concepts
Event Handling: Using KeyListener to handle keyboard inputs for controlling the snake.
Graphics: Using Graphics and Graphics2D classes for drawing the snake, food, and game board.
Timers: Using javax.swing.Timer to create the game loop that updates the game state at regular intervals.
Randomization: Using java.util.Random to generate random positions for the food.
Lists: Using java.util.ArrayList to store the coordinates of the snake's segments.
